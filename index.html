    In Kashur and Urdu, Amn means peace, calmness, and tranquility. And so Amn Candles was made with only one intent in mind, to spread as much
    Amn as we can. We are a small South Asian owned business determined to provide you the highest quality of all the classic scents
    you know and love as well as ethnic smells that will leave you feeling like you are in the outdoor bazaars overseas all at 
    an afforable price.
    
    Everyone is unique, and so are each of our favorite scents from Vanilla bean and Lavender all the way to Ood and Masaladar chai, 
    it's our goal to bring some Amn to everyone through which ever scent they love.
